# Corrected_Sony-RMT-P1BT-BLE-Camera-Remote-Tester
Camera remote tester app and an eventual library for BLE remote controls other than this one.

This was mostly modified and developed within AIDE so a lot of stuff is stripped out to compile

This was mostly modified and developed within AIDE so a lot of stuff in build.gradle was stripped out to successfully compile. Minimum Android version is 11 due to needing GATT server support.
